# READ ME
This is a personal website of **DingShizhe**, a college student in UCAS, Beijing, China.  

You may find something interesting here, which is not what I want share with you but myself.

## Why I build it
I want to build it when I was young. Last month, I started to do it.

For several weeks, day and night, I think about the purpose of my life. I try to find where is the values of my fate.

Though I havenot got the finial answer, I realize I need do something special. 

I believe a little bit that the purpose of my life is no other than myself, and that the values I should quest must be different. 

*Values come from differences. I am the unique.*

Therefore I build this site, named after me.

**To those who are with passion for life.**
